I have already learned html and a little bit of css when I was 14-16. I was introduced to python at 14 too. I learned Python basics at 17-18. 
I read an article today which said I can become a full stack develper with html, css, a little bit of Javascript and django(Python Framework).
Is this really true? By lookinga t my situation I can try for full stack development. Since i was already interested in web development in my childhood. 
I can just revise those things and learn Javascript and start things.
I need to do more research.
